Tunable expression is achieved by varying the level of lysozyme (lysY), the natural inhibitor of T7 RNA polymerase. The level of lysozyme is modulated by adding L-rhamnose to the expression culture at levels from zero to 2000 µM. When Lemo21(DE3) is grown without rhamnose, the strain performs the same as a pLysS containing strain. However, optional addition of rhamnose tunes the expression of the protein of interest. For difficult soluble proteins, tuning the expression level may also result in more soluble, properly folded protein.",fhuA2 [lon] ompT gal (λ DE3) [dcm] ∆hsdS/ pLemo(CamR)  λ DE3 = λ sBamHIo ∆EcoRI B int::(lacI::PlacUV5::T7 gene1) i21 ∆nin5 pLemo = pACYC184-PrhaBAD-lysY,,,,28,GM48,GM48,GM48,JM101,JM101,JM101,JM109,JM109,JM109
